## My Process

The landing page is built using a variety of technologies and tools. With any project, I first brainstorm how I want the website to look and feel. I then will create any necessary files, icons, logos, and designs that I will be using to create the website.

### Built with

- [HTML5] - HTML5
- [Tailwindcss] - TailwindCSS
- CSS Custom Properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-First Design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS Library
- [React-Icons](https://reacticons.com/) - React Icons
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Vite Library

### Other Tools & Resources

### What I Learned

During this project, I learned how to build an appealing landing page ustilizing TailwindCSS for the first time. I really like and prefer it over Bootstrap. I also further learned how to utilize React and building React components.

### Continued development

I hope to improve upon on my developing skills utilizing TailwindCSS and React in future projects. Additionally, learning how to add more functionality features is something I'm looking forward to discovering and adding to future projects.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This really helped me for implementing Tailwind. I think the documentation is very clear and easy to follow.
- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - React documentation is a great way to get started with React. It's a great way to learn how to build your own React components.
